My first repository for the endless quest of knowledge acquisition. I knight thee Sir Hello-World

Hi!

My name is Luke. I'm leaning how to program. Finally. Software is eating the world and I'd like to add a few teeth. But! I won't be quitting my day job, so I consider this night school or a glorified hobby, my virtual man cave (women can have caves too). 

Rawr.
